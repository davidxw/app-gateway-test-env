# App Gateway Test Environment

This repo sets up a test environment for Azure Application Gateway. It creates the following resources:
* Azure Virtual Network with subnets for the Application Gateway and a Container App Environment
* Azure Container App Environment with two sample apps. Public ingress is enabled for the Container App Environment.
* Azure Application Gateway with a public IP address and two backend pools, one for each sample app
* A basic Application Gateway routing rule sending all traffic to the first sample app
* An Azure Log Analytics workspace for both App Gateway and Container App Environment logs

The sample app deployed is https://github.com/davidxw/webHttpTest. After the deployment is complete, you can test the sample app at the following URL:
```
http://<app-gateway-public-ip>/api/echo
```
